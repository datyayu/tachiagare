# Tachiagare!

This is what happens when I'm free and home-alone on a weekend.


## How to run

Clone the repo, then:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Want to contribute with songs?

If you want to sync songs by your own, you can use the tool at [https://github.com/datyayu/tachiagare-demo/](https://github.com/datyayu/tachiagare-demo/)

Just download it, follow the instructions on the readme to run the tool and edit the `test.json` file with your song's info and lyrics.

If you can figure out how to make lyrics with that, then you are cool and I will accept any PR you send me :)
